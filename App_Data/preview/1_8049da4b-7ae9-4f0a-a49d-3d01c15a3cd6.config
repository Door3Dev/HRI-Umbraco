<h3 class="expand-link"><span class="expand-toggle">[ + ]</span>What kind of financial assistance is available?</h3>
<div class="expand-content" style="display: none;">
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Avenir LT W01 45 Book', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22px;">If you earn less than 400% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) you may be eligible for assistance from the federal government to help pay for your coverage. This is up to $45,960 for an individual and up to $96,200 for a family of four.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Avenir LT W01 45 Book', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22px;">There are two types of financial assistance: one is advanced premium tax credits (APTC) and the second is cost-sharing reductions (CSRs). For those who are eligible for APTCs, you have the option of having the federal government pay that amount of the premium to Health Republic directly, allowing you to pay a smaller portion of the total premium each month; alternatively, you can receive the full premium tax credit towards your 2014 taxes when you file them. For those who are also eligible for CSRs, the federal government can assist with your copayments and deductibles too.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Avenir LT W01 45 Book', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22px;">We recommend that you use the tax credit and subsidy calculator on the New York State of Health: <a href="http://nystateofhealth.ny.gov/" target="_blank">nystateofhealth.ny.gov</a> to determine your eligibility, and to take advantage of this financial assistance.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Avenir LT W01 45 Book', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22px;">Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans, or CO-OPs, are private, member-governed health insurance companies. New CO-OPs are forming across the country as part of the Affordable Care Act, with the goal of reducing health care costs and making health insurance people accessible to millions of people. Health Republic Insurance of New York is one of 23 CO-OPs nationally.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Avenir LT W01 45 Book', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22px;">We are not a subsidiary of Freelancers Union, and membership in Health Republic Insurance of New York provides no benefits in Freelancers Insurance Company.</p>

        <block2Content><![CDATA[<h3>Our Reimbursement Philosophy</h3>
<p>Here are a few key points to get the conversation started:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Reimbursement</span></strong>: In the first year, reimbursement is based on a fee-for-service model. But, once we have data about our members and their needs, we will add quality incentives and move towards alternative payment models. This will allow better alignment between reimbursement and our shared objective of improved clinical outcomes.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Care Coordination Reimbursement</span></strong>: We understand coordination of care is increasingly complex, and you need support.Â  To reinforce physician involvement in care transitions and episodic care, we reimburse for: Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â </p>
<ul>
<li>Telephone Evaluation and Management Services</li>
<li>On-line Evaluation and Management Service</li>
<li>Transitional Care Management Services</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Counseling and Risk Factor Reduction Reimbursement</span></strong>: To help physicians spend their time advising patients about their health, we reimburse the following services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smoking Cessation Counseling, Alcohol and Substance Abuse Counseling</li>
<li>Â Preventive Medicine Individual and Group Counseling</li>
</ul>]]></block2Content>
        <block3Content><![CDATA[<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<ul class="unstyled expand-list">
<li class="expand-group">
<h3 class="expand-link"><span class="expand-toggle">[ + ]</span>What is a CO-OP?</h3>
<div class="expand-content" style="display: none;">
<p><span style="font-family: 'Avenir LT W01 45 Book', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22px;">Health Republic Insurance of New York is a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan, created under the Affordable Care Act. CO-OPs serve individuals and small businesses and those who have been traditionally underserved by the more established health carriers. Profits are invested in lower premiums or better benefits. In time, our Board will have a majority representation of people who actually have insurance from Health Republic. We are also encouraged to test innovations in health care coverage.</span></p>
</div>
</li>
<li class="expand-group">
<h3 class="expand-link"><span class="expand-toggle">[ + ]</span>What is the primary physician concept?</h3>
<div class="expand-content" style="display: none;">
<p><span style="font-family: 'Avenir LT W01 45 Book', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22px;">Although many people use the term âPrimary Care Physician,â we believe the term âPrimary Physicianâ better captures what most people needâ¦a doctor who: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>understands them and their individual needs</li>
<li>is available for questions and concerns</li>
<li>stands at the center of a large array of services</li>
</ul>
We are incentivizing our members to select a Primary Physician and use that doctor for both preventive care and treatment. We will partner with the Primary Physicians as needed to support member health education, behavior change and analytics.</div>
</li>
<li class="expand-group">
<h3 class="expand-link"><span class="expand-toggle">[ + ]</span>What is the network and when are referrals required?</h3>
<div class="expand-content" style="display: none;">
<p><span style="font-family: 'Avenir LT W01 45 Book', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22px;">Health Republic Insurance of New York relies on MagnaCare for the foundation of its network. The MagnaCare network has been reviewed and approved by the New York State Department of Health to offer sufficient coverage in the counties we serve. It includes many of the stateâs key hospitals. In addition to MagnaCare, Health Republic is contracting with community health centers and accountable care organizations, especially those with the infrastructure to support population management. Thus, we call our network âMagnaCare Extra.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Avenir LT W01 45 Book', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22px;">Health Republic Health plans do not have out of network benefits, thus all specialty services must be provided by clinicians in the Magnacare Extra network. In the rare instance that a patient requires a unique specialized service, please contact us directly. We do not require any referrals from the Primary Physician to access other services. However, please review and reference the Prior Approval lists (in the Important Resources section) to ensure that the use of medications and procedures follow our requirements. </span></p>
</div>
</li>
<li class="expand-group">
<h3 class="expand-link"><span class="expand-toggle">[ + ]</span>How can a provider participate in your network?</h3>
<div class="expand-content" style="display: none;">
<p><span style="font-family: 'Avenir LT W01 45 Book', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22px;">For most specialty and ancillary providers, we partner with MagnaCare to build our network. To assure faster service, please call them directly at 888.624.6202.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Avenir LT W01 45 Book', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22px;">Community health centers, patient centered medical homes, and accountable care organizations may call our Provider Relations Department at 646.679.4575. </span></p>
</div>
</li>
<li class="expand-group">
<h3 class="expand-link"><span class="expand-toggle">[ + ]</span>Do you cover complementary and alternative care (CAM)?</h3>
<div class="expand-content" style="display: none;">
<p><span style="font-family: 'Avenir LT W01 45 Book', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22px;">Beyond the required chiropractic coverage and a select number of acupuncture visits for certain diagnoses, Health Republic Insurance of New York does not provide CAM benefits. However, our members can access CAM providers through Healthways WholeHealth Living, where they can search and select credentialed providers, all of whom will provide a discount on their fees to our members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Avenir LT W01 45 Book', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22px;">With limited exceptions CAM is not included in the benefit designs of HRI NY Products; Chiropractic is a covered benefit. Acupuncture is a covered benefit for Primary Select and Primary Select EPO products. </span></p>

        <header><![CDATA[<p>Health Republic Insurance of New York is a true not-for-profit program and New Yorkâs only CO-OP -- Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan.Â  CO-OPs are private, member-governed health insurance companies forming across the country as part of the Affordable Care Act. Â Health Republic Insurance of New York is one of 23 CO-OPs nationally.</p>]]></header>
        <content><![CDATA[<h3>Not-for-Profit.Â  For People.</h3>
<p>Just as people come together to form credit unions, electric, food and housing coops, our CO-OP members join together to invest all profits back into a better system.Â  Health Republic has three primary goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>reduce health care costs</li>
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 
<li>make health insurance accessible to millions of people</li>
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 
<li>give individuals a voice in their health care</li>
</ol>
<h3>Weâre Different.</h3>
<p>Health Republic Insurance of New Yorkâs benefit packages are different and our membership experience is different.Â  Hereâs just a few of our special features:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have the lowest-priced health insurance option in most of the markets we serve.</li>
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 
<li>With our PrimarySelect plans, when you choose a Primary Physician, there are no-copays or deductibles on visits to that physician.</li>
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 
<li>We have no gatekeepers â you need no referral to see any provider in our network.</li>
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 
<li>We have Wellness Navigators standing by to help our members make the most of their benefits and find community resources to stay healthy.</li>
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 
<li>Our members have access to more than 40 types of alternative care and fitness providers, all providing significant discounts on their services.</li>
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 
<li>Our members will vote for the leadership of our organization.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Weâre The Same.</h3>
<p>At the same time, we are held to the same high standards for all New York health insurance organizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>All health insurance plans in New York must cover the same set of Essential Health Benefits. These include medical care, medications, mental health care, and a host of other services.</li>
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 
<li>Our EssentialCare plans meet all conditions for the New York State âstandardâ plan, allowing consumers to make an apples-to-apples comparison.</li>
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 
<li>Our benefit plans, premiums and provider network coverage are all approved and monitored by the New York State Department of Financial Services.</li>
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â </ul>]]></content>
